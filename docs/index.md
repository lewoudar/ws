A simple yet powerful websocket cli.

## Why?

Each time I work on a web project involving websockets, I found myself wanting a simple (cli) tool to test what I have
coded. What I often do is to write a python script using [websockets](https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
There are graphical tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), but I'm not confortable with.
So I decided to write a cli tool for this purpose.
