# install-completion

The first command to use is `install-completion` to have auto-completion for commands and options using the `TAB` key.
Auto-completion is available on `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. For Windows users, I don't forget you (I'm also a Windows
user), support is planned for `Powershell` ;)

```shell
$ ws install-completion
# when the command succeeded, you should see the following message
Successfully installed completion script!
```
